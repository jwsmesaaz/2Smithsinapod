                <h3>Jon's Story:</h3><br />
                Coming Soon Jon will get his story of our meeting, dating and proposal up so you can read it so come back soon for that.
                I came into Sacrament meeting just before it started. I sat with a few of my friends and that is when I saw her two rows ahead of me. I remember thinking to myself how beautiful she was. Since she was alone I thought what if I move up a couple rows and go sit with her. While I was debating another friend of mine came and sat next to her. I thought to myself this is perfect; I can be introduced and talk with her without the awkwardness of having to introduce myself to her. Needless to say all during the meeting I was distracted by the red head with such a beautiful smile right in front of me. 
                <br/><br/>
                After the meeting I called to my friend who I home taught at the time and decided to set up my home teaching appointment. My plan worked! Not only did I set up home teaching but I was introduced to Shana Lynn Thompson. The next week I showed up to church in a tux and we ate food for Mingles. She has such a great personality, I thought as we spoke. Time went by and I learned more about Shana. 
                <br/><br/>
                I remember going to the traditional after conference FHE where I really talked to her one-on-one for the first time. That is when I found out how much she loves children and other people. I wanted to ask her on a date right there, but was so scared of rejection that I didn't at that time. When the Halloween party came, she was there dressed in a great costume: her Wildcats jacket. We hung out and talked and found out that we both watch Doctor Who. I also discovered that Shana hadn't seen the most recent season of Doctor Who, which I happened to have. 
                <br/><br/>
                BAM there was my chance! I offered to come over and bring it with me so we could watch it. I had a plan. I would bring my PS3 to watch it and bring it home with me after (so I would have to come back :). After watching Doctor Who we would stay up and talk until I had to go to work at midnight. It was great. I decided that I was going to finally ask her on a date that night but she was tired and said that she might not remember our talk in the morning. So I thought better and decided to wait. 
                <br/><br/>
                The next time I was going to see her was at FHE the next day. I went there excited to ask her on a date but didn't see her there. Even now I can't remember seeing her even though both her and her friend says that they said hi. Since I had set up a bunch of Christmas lights at Infusionsoft and wanted to show off how I had made them dance to music I decided to get some friends to go watch them. One of our teams had created a 27 foot tall Christmas tree made out of boxes that were wrapped up. The lights danced to music and were spread over the football field in the middle of our building. I asked her if she would like to come with us. She agreed and we planned it for Boxing Day. 
                <br/><br/>
                Then the Christmas special of Doctor Who aired Christmas Day 2013. I was texting her all that day and we had plans to watch it that night. I made all my friends wait until she could come over before I would put it on. She came over and watched it with a friend and his cousin. She stuck around after the movie for 3 hours and we talked. Then the next day I picked her up and we went and had dinner and went over to the lights show. Did that sound like a date to you? That is what it ended up being and while we were watching the lights my hand ended up holding hers. 
                <br/><br/>
                As we went home we were talking about how she usually doesn't hold hands with guys in front of other people. When we got to her house we hadn't finished talking yet. We talked in the car and it came to a point in the conversation when we were holding hands over the center console and I was looking at her face and I though how lucky I was to be able to be me right now. As I was looking into her eyes I broke a rule I had never broken before. Never kiss on the first date. Apparently she had the same rule. Luckily she was also willing to break it. 
                <br/><br/>
                I was feeling really good. All the way home I couldn't stop smiling. She is amazing and fun, has a great personality and loves children. Shana helps people and her smile makes me happy just to be alive and see it. She is so smart and witty. I love spending time with her as often as I could.
                <br/><br/>
                The next day I went over and saw her again and we talked for hours about all sorts of stuff as well as texting each other all day. One day while talking we got onto the subject of marriage. Now this wasn't really strange since the first time after we watch Doctor Who we had arrived at the same subject. Actually that entire conversation was about weddings and other conversations we had touched on the subject. This time however was different. I started thinking that I was going to marry her. 
                <br/><br/>
                My mind was going crazy. We hadn't been dating that long, you don't deserve her (Still true), why would she want to marry you. I decided to go to the Temple and pray. I went right after work the next day. I found out that the Temple had closed 10 minutes before I arrived. I went home and prayed and felt like I should marry Shana but that I needed to give her time to let her come to the same conclusion. I then went to bed. When I woke up I decided that I must have just really wanted the answer that I received so I prayed again. I received the same answer but also a little more, that I should tell her that I would wait for her as long as it took her to decide. 
                <br/><br/>
                We continued to see each other every day. We continued to talk and snuggle and laugh. Then Shana told me about this test that a colleague had created. The test was the top reasons why couples get divorced. I have to admit that I was nervous. We had talked a lot and I didn't want to get the questions wrong. The assignment was to separately fill out these 106 questions and we went our separate ways for the night. 
                <br/><br/>
                The entire rest of the weekend was going to be BIG. Elder Holland of the quorum of the twelve Apostles was supposed to come and speak with us. I was super excited. I got off of work early went home and went to bed and only slept for about 4.5 hours. Then I went over to Shana's house where we waited for the conference that night. Elder Holland didn't end up coming but we heard from Sheri do and Elder La Sweuer. 
                <br/><br/>
                That weekend was amazing. Shana and I spent the entire time together we would go to bed tired and wake up excited to hear the spiritual leaders and those called to give us instructions. It was a very spiritual experience. Then on Sunday we were able to sing together at ASU Gammage in front of 4,000 people. It was an experience of a life time.
                <br/><br/>
                During the conference we were also filling out the 106 questions as we were waiting. When I got to the last question I was excited to see it was, “Are you ready to marry him/her”. I was thinking that she might be ready and that is why we were doing the quiz so she could tell me that she was ready. 
                <br/><br/>
                We planned to compare answers on Monday but there was a little disruption to those plans. We ended up talking that entire evening. Good news came out of it though Shana decided that she wanted to marry me. I was so happy. What did I do to deserve this? After she said it she started making plans. My sister came over to help and it was exciting and thrilling and I really can't describe with words how good I felt. 
                <br/><br/>
                The next day we went over our answers. I was super nervous. What if they were different or if I got one of hers wrong or if one of mine scared her away. It turns out that we had nothing to worry about. For me there was only one new thing that came up that I didn't know before. Our answers matched perfectly. I was even so thrilled when one of the answers that I wrote down was better then what she wrote for herself. 
                <br/><br/>
                We started talking about telling people. I had to talk with my parents who until this point we hadn't told that we were dating. Wednesday I went and asked them how they would feel if we got married. They approved and Shana came over to my house and talked with my mom and sister for most of the night (I was kind of bummed that I wasn't able to really talk with her because she was talking with my mom and sister most of the night).
                <br/><br/>
                After talking with my family they set Friday to go look at wedding dresses and shopping and getting to know each other better. I decided that while they were out on the girl’s night that I would go talk with her dad. I had planned to do it Thursday but her father’s birthday was that day.
                <br/><br/>
                As I went over to talk with Shana’s father I was super nervous. I was about to ask for one of the greatest gifts that I could ever be given. I knew that I had to do it but I was so scared of rejection. What if he didn’t approve of me? I had only met him once before.
                <br/><br/>
                We talked for about an hour about all sorts of stuff. I asked him and he approved. It turns out that making his daughter happy and fixing the surround sound tipped the scales in my favor. I left to go home and on the way I was so excited. Just before I got home however I started feeling sick.
                <br/><br/>
                It turns out that I had caught the flu. Usually that wouldn’t be that bad. Usually I am down for a day at most however this time I was delirious and in bed for almost 3 days straight. During that time Shana would come over and take care of me. She cared so much even though half of what I said didn’t make any sense. Finally I was good enough to go back to work.
                <br/><br/>
                We continued to see each other and plan for a wedding even though I hadn’t formally proposed. We set a date of March 22nd then after Shana had talked to her family it was changed to March 21st. Then April 26th was free and we decided that if we took that date we would have more time to plan and save. We decided on that date.
                <br/><br/>
                We got an awesome photographer and Shana continued to go wedding dress shopping but I still hadn’t actually proposed. My problem was that I didn’t have a ring. I had been looking and talking with Shana about what she liked. I still hadn’t found anything though. Then as I was talking to a jeweler I found the ring. He had to order it and the stone (Shana didn’t want a diamond as the center stone).
                <br/><br/>
                One week to get the ring and another week to put it all together. That means that I had a choice. I could either wait about 2 weeks to get the ring to propose or I could borrow a family ring to propose and give her the ring when it was ready. If I waited then I would have to choose the stone but if I proposed then she could come with me and choose the stone that she wanted. I decided to go with the second option.
                <br/><br/>
                January 26, 2014, one month to the day since the Christmas lights and our first kiss was the day I decided to get down on one knee and ask. I had it planned out since the day after I asked her father’s permission but I was waiting on that ring. As we had already been preparing for the reception I was going to use sneak the question in with some preparation.
                <br/><br/>
                I still didn’t have a ring but was going to use my Grandmother’s ring while hers was still coming in and being assembled. Unfortunately she had a headache and I was feeling sick that day. After church we ended up going to my parent’s house where she talked with my sister and I took a nap. After my nap we went over to her grandparent’s house.
                <br/><br/>
                On the way to Shana’s grandparents’ house she called her other grandparents and told them over speaker phone. They were super excited. Once we got off the phone we arrived at the house. We asked her grandfather if he would seal us in the temple for time and all eternity. I found out that her grandparents knew my grandfather really well. As a matter of fact Shana had lived under the roof that I grandpa had provided the materials to seal.
                <br/><br/>
                It was amazing how small a world we live in. After we were finished at the grandparents we went to her parent’s house and talked for about an hour or two. It is hard to keep track of time. On the way back from that I was feeling ill still and had to go into work at 1am. That was 4 hours away. Shana called her aunt and told her that we were getting married. By the time I got home I was exhausted. I went to bed and slept for about 3 hours then went to work.
                <br/><br/>
                On Monday I went and made the first payment on the ring. The jeweler had ordered the ring and the stone to put into the ring. It is going to look amazing. We had so much to do. We saw each other for a little that day and talked a little. On Tuesday I was feeling sick again and we only talked a little bit of time together. Wednesday the 29th we broke up.
                <br/<br/>
                That’s right we broke up and I was devastated. Let me be honest. We agreed that we would break up January 29th in December. As the day approached I was apprehensive that she would go through with it and we wouldn’t get back together. I sent her a text as soon as I got up and she ended up calling me telling me that we were broken up and that I should get over there.
                <br/><br/>
                I quickly got ready and went over. As soon as I got over there he hugged and decided that we were never going to break up again. 20 minutes being broken up was long enough for us 
                <br/><br/>
                I think that Thursday was the longest day ever. I went into work at 1am then for lunch I forgot my jacket so I drove home to get it then drove all the way back which took my entire lunch. At 7am we had a bus that took us up to Flagstaff where our team was until about 6pm. Since I was so tired (I had been up for 24 hours at this point) and I still had a 30 minute drive home I decided to take a nap on a love sack that we had at the office. I ended up sleeping for 3 hours.
                <br/><br/>
                I finally got home at 9:30 and was so happy to see Shana there. I was feeling sick, tired and hungry but just seeing her there made the entire world alright. We talked read scriptures and went our separate ways as we were going to the temple early the next morning for a tour.
                <br/><br/>
                Friday January 31st, 2014. The day arrived and it was cloudy and a little cold. I got ready and was super nervous. I had borrowed my great grandmother’s ring. As I slide it into my sock hoping that it wouldn’t slide out or that Shana wouldn’t see the bulge I was so nervous. Not that she would say no but that everything wouldn’t go perfectly. I had been thinking about it all week. I had planned another way of asking her but this was a once in a lifetime opportunity.
                <br/><br/>
                I went over to get her and I was about 15 minutes later then what we had planned. We drove over to the temple and talked about wedding stuff. I played her the songs that I was going to use in my original idea on the way over. When we arrived the sun wasn’t visible through. It was one thing I was hoping for.
                <br/><br/>
                We ended up being the last people in the first group to go through the 8:00am tour. We watched the video and went over to the temple. Once our group got into the lobby I made sure that we were at the end of the group. Our group went through the temple quickly it seemed like. While going down the stairs I thought that the ring box was coming out of my sock I tried to fix it but decided it will either stay in or fall out and I’ll deal with it. Finally we were to the Celestial room and I pulled her off to one side of the room.
                <br/><br/>
                I was hoping that the sun would be shining through the stain glass on one side and the Celestial room would be on the other. Darn clouds. I tried to wait until everyone had left the room but was feeling so nervous that I just had to do it. I took both her hands in mine and started down on one knee.
                <br/><br/>
                “No, no, no!” Shana said as I was half way down. What to do? Did she not want to marry me? Was it just that she didn’t want me to ask her here? I decided that I would go forward with faith that she would say yes and I hoped that I had just surprised her. I looked into her eyes and knew everything was going to be alright. “Shana, I love your eternally and want to be with you forever. Will you marry me?” I said as I pulled out my great grandmother’s ring. Then the pause as Shana gathered herself. “Yes” she whispered. I slipped the ring on her finger and stood up. We had a huge hug that was kind of interrupted by the usher that was at the end congratulating us. We walked out and the users from the hall all congratulated us. Shana was super smiley and her face was super red. We took a few pictures and left.
                <br/><br/>
                On the way home she sent out texts to a bunch of people and I told her about the other plan that I had come up with where I was going to have us listen to a CD. The CD was music that I had put together for our reception. The second to last song would be a slow song and I was planning on pulling over and asking her to practice dancing with her. I had been talking about how we needed to get more pictures and videos of us. This was to prepare her for my plan so it wouldn’t be weird when I put up my video camera to watch us dance. I had made a blank track that had white noise at the end that would give me time to wrap up and ask the question. After that the song from when we first kissed would play.
                <br/><br/>
                I was telling her about this as we were listening to the CD. The white noise played and I told her why I loved her and as we came to where we had our first kiss the song began to play. One thing I forgot to say is that I didn’t know what song we first kissed to and Shana was keeping it a secret from me. I convinced my sister to tell me though so it would have more meaning.
                <br/><br/>
                And thus it came to pass that we came to be engaged for eternity.
